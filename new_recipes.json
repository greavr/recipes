Add 8 tablespoons butter and 1/2 cup shortening and pulse until the mixture looks like coarse meal. Gradually add 1/2 to 2/3 cup ice water, pulsing until the dough just comes together; scrape down the sides of the food processor.\nPut the dough on the floured surface and roll it into a ball. Cut the dough in half; roll out 1 piece into a 13-inch round, about 1/8 inch thick. Gently roll up the dough onto the floured rolling pin and unroll into the pie plate. Press the dough into the bottom and sides of the pan; refrigerate until ready to use. Roll out the second half of the dough into a 13-inch round, about 1/8 inch thick. Lay it on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet and refrigerate.\nMaking the filling: Combine 3 cups blueberries and 1/2 cup sugar in a small saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a simmer, then cook until reduced by half, about 20 minutes. Scrape the mixture into a large bowl; add the remaining 3 cups blueberries and 1/2 cup sugar, the jam, 3 tablespoons flour, lemon zest and juice, and pinch of salt. Stir to combine and set aside to cool completely.\nPreheat the oven to 425 degrees. Spoon the filling into the crust-lined pie pan. Dot with 2 tablespoons butter.

Tuck the edge of the top crust under the edge of the bottom crust. Pinch the edge to flute and seal. Use a small knife to cut a 1-inch hole in the center of the top crust.\nPut the pie on a baking sheet. Bake in the center of the oven for 15 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees and bake 30 more minutes.\nMeanwhile, make the glaze: Combine 1/2 cup sugar, orange juice and 1/4 cup water in a small saucepan over low heat. Simmer gently until the glaze coats the back of a spoon about 10 minutes. Open the oven door and slide the rack out slightly. Pour the glaze over the pie and into the opening in the top crust.

Using a sharp small knife, remove the skins of the tomatoes. (If the tomatoes are too hot, you can protect your finger tips by rubbing them with an ice cube between tomatoes.) Once the tomatoes are peeled, cut them in halves or quarters and remove the seeds and juice from their centers. Also cut out and discard the stem area.\nMake sure there is a top rack in place in your oven. Turn on the oven to 450\u00b0F to preheat.\nWhile the oven is heating, chop up the tomatoes finely. Put tomatoes, garlic, 1 Tbsp olive oil, vinegar in a bowl and mix. Add the chopped basil. Add salt and pepper to taste.\nSlice the baguette on a diagonal about 1/2 inch thick slices. Coat one side of each slice with olive oil using a pastry brush. Place on a cooking sheet, olive oil side down. You will want to toast them in the top rack in your oven, so you may need to do these in batches depending on the size of your oven. Once the oven has reached 450\u00b0F, place a tray of bread slices in the oven on the top rack. Toast for 5-6 minutes, until the bread just begins to turn golden brown.\nAlternatively, you can toast the bread without coating it in olive oil first. Toast on a griddle for 1 minute on each side. Take a sharp knife and score each slice 3 times. Rub some garlic in the slices and drizzle half a teaspoon of olive oil on each slice. This is the more traditional method of making bruschetta.\nAlign the bread on a serving platter, olive oil side up. Either place the tomato topping in a bowl separately with a spoon for people to serve themselves over the bread, or place some topping on each slice of bread and serve. If you top each slice with the tomatoes, do it right before serving or the bread may get soggy.",

Use the whisk to combine the egg yolk, coconut milk, butter, and vanilla extract.\nAdd the liquid ingredients to the dry ingredients and use a rubber spatula to gently stir. Switch to a folding motion toward the end to incorporate all the flour. If the resulting batter looks lumpy, that's okay. Expect the batter to be thick. Avoid over-stirring, lest the batter becomes over worked and yields a chewy, tough waffle.

Do not shortchange this creaming step, and if using a hand mixer, 6-7 minutes may be necessary. Don't overbeat or overdo it so that the oils start releasing; just make sure the mixture is properly creamed.\nStop, scrape down the sides of the bowl, and add flour, cornstarch, cinnamon, baking soda, salt, and mix on low speed until just incorporated, about 1 minute; don't overmix. The dough will be soft and on the oily side, but it should come together and not be sticky, tacky, or wet. Then cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate dough for at least 3 hours, or up to 5 days. Do not bake with warm dough because cookies will spread and bake thinner and flatter. Properly chilled dough is mandatory.\nPreheat oven to 350F, line a baking sheet with a Silpat, or spray with cooking spray. Using a medium 2-inch cookie scoop, form heaping two-tablespoon mounds. Place mounds on baking sheet, spaced at least 2 inches apart (bake 8 cookies per sheet) and flatten each one slightly. Bake for 8 minutes, or until edges have set and tops are just beginning to set, even if slightly undercooked, pale and glossy in the center. Do not bake longer than 9 minutes if you want Softbatch-style cookies because they firm up as they cool. Allow cookies to cool on the baking sheet for about 5 minutes before removing and transferring to a rack to finish cooling.\nStore cookies airtight at room temperature for up to 1 week, or in the freezer for up to 4 months. Alternatively, unbaked cookie dough can be stored airtight in the refrigerator for up to 5 days, or in the freezer for up to 4 months, so consider baking only as many cookies as desired and save the remaining dough to be baked in the future when desired.",

Working with a piece of well-floured dough, send through the roller on the widest setting, thickness of 0. Fold in thirds and rotate so that straight edges are on the side and send it through again. Fold in thirds once more, again with straight edges on sides, and then send it through thickness 0 for a third pass.\nThen, change thickness to 1 and send dough through once. Ensure your dough always has enough flour so that it doesn't stick to your roller. Continue process stepping through thicknesses 2, 3, 4 and 5 being the last.\nCut pasta to desired size. Ensure each of the noodles are well covered in flour so they don't stick. You can't go overboard here because it will all come off when you cook the pasta. Either set on cookie sheet until ready to cook or dry pasta on a drying rack.\nTo cook, bring a large pot of heavily-salted water to a boil.

Add the butter and break it up roughly with your fingers, making sure to keep visible little chunks of butter in the dough. Add 2 tablespoons of cold water and bring the dough together. Add a tiny bit more water if necessary, but not too much. Cover the dough and refrigerate for 20 minutes.\nTurn out the dough onto a lightly floured board, knead gently, and form into a neat rectangle. Roll the dough away from you (not back and forth), forming a 8x20 inch rectangle. Try to keep the edges even, and don\u2019t overwork the butter streaks. Flecks of butter should still be visible in the dough.\nFold the top third of the dough down to the center, then the bottom third up and over that. Give the dough a quarter turn (left or right) and roll out again to three times the length. Fold the same way as before, cover, and chill for 30 minutes.\nWhile the dough is resting, make the filling. Dissolve 1/2 cup sugar into the cup of hot water, and allow to cool to room temperature. Whisk eggs and evaporated milk together and then thoroughly whisk in the sugar water and vanilla. Strain through a very fine mesh strainer--this step is extremely important to getting a smooth, glassy egg tart.\nPreheat oven to 400 degrees and position a rack in the lower third of your oven. Roll out the dough and cut circles to fit your tins (you can also use a shallow muffin pan). Press the dough into the tins and use a ladle to fill each tart shell until just reaching the edges of the outside crust. Once filled, immediately (but very carefully) transfer the pan to the oven and bake for 15 minutes. Reduce the temperature to 350 degrees and bake another 10-12 minutes, until filling is just set (if a toothpick can stand up in it, it\u2019s done). If you see the shells start to puff up a bit, crack open the oven a little, and they should settle back down.\nYou can let the tarts cool for a couple minutes and enjoy them while they\u2019re still hot.",

Cover and refrigerate for a half hour or overnight.\nPut rice in a large bowl. Fill the bowl halfway with cold water. Swish rice around for a few seconds and pour off the cloudy water.

Season the chicken thighs with salt and pepper; set aside.\nHeat 2 teaspoons oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering but not smoking. Add the pepper strips and cook, stirring occasionally, until the skin begins to blister and turn spotty black, 3 to 4 minutes. Transfer the pepper to a small plate and set aside.\nAdd 1 teaspoon oil to the now-empty Dutch oven; heat the oil until shimmering but not smoking. Add the chicken pieces in a single layer; cook, without moving the pieces, until browned, about 3 minutes. Turn the pieces and brown on the second side, about 3 minutes longer; transfer the chicken to a medium bowl. Reduce the heat to medium and add the chorizo to the pot; cook, stirring frequently, until deeply browned and the fat begins to render, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer the chorizo to the bowl with the chicken and set aside.\nAdd enough oil to the fat in the Dutch oven to equal 2 tablespoons; heat over medium heat until shimmering but not smoking. Add the onion and cook, stirring frequently, until softened, about 3 minutes; stir in the remaining garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in the tomatoes; cook until the mixture begins to darken and thicken slightly, about 3 minutes. Stir in the rice and cook until the grains are well coated with the tomato mixture, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in the chicken broth, wine, saffron, bay leaf, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Return the chicken and chorizo to the pot, increase the heat to medium-high, and bring to a boil, uncovered, stirring occasionally. Cover the pot and transfer it to the oven; cook until the rice absorbs almost all of the liquid, about 15 minutes.\nRemove the paella from the oven (close the oven door to retain heat). Uncover the paella; scatter the shrimp over the rice, insert the mussels hinged-side down into the rice (so they stand upright), arrange the bell pepper strips in a pinwheel pattern, and scatter the peas over the top. Cover and return to the oven; cook until the shrimp are opaque and the mussels have opened, 10 to 12 minutes.\nSet the Dutch oven, uncovered, over medium-high heat for about 5 minutes, rotating the pot 180 degrees after about 2 minutes for even browning.\nLet the paella stand, covered, about 5 minutes. Discard any mussels that have not opened and the bay leaf, if it can be easily removed. Sprinkle the paella with the parsley and serve, passing the lemon wedges separately.",

Set aside.\nUsing your stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the pumpkin, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg, and salt together on medium speed. Add the warmed milk/butter and beat until combined, then beat in the egg and yeast.\nWith the mixer running on low speed, add 1 cup of flour. Mix for 1 minute, scraping down the sides of the bowl frequently. Add 1 and 1/4 cups more flour and beat for 1 more minute. The dough will be very soft. Place dough into a greased bowl. Turn the dough around in the bowl so all sides of the dough are coated. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and allow to rise in a warm environment until doubled in size about 1 1/2 hours.\nGently punch the dough down to deflate it and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead the dough a few times so it is smooth. If it is too sticky, knead in a little more flour.\nIn a small bowl combine 1/2 cup brown sugar, cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg, cloves and allspice into a small bowl, set aside\nRoll the dough out into a 18x10 inch rectangle. Spread 6 tablespoons softened butter evenly on top. Sprinkle brown sugar mixture all over the top. Roll it up tightly. Cut into 12 pieces, about 1 1/2 inches each. Arrange rolls into a greased 9-inch round pan.\nCover with plastic wrap and allow the rolls to rise again in a warm environment until doubled in size. This takes about 1 hour. If using the overnight method, place the pan into the fridge and allow the rolls to rest for up to 14 hours before baking. When it\u2019s time to bake the next day, allow the rolls to come up to room temperature and rise for 1 hour on the counter, or until almost doubled in size.\nPreheat oven to 350\u00b0F. Bake the rolls for 22-28 minutes, covering with foil at the 15 minute mark to prevent heavy browning. Remove from oven and allow to slightly cool as you prepare the icing.\nUsing a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the softened cream cheese on medium speed until smooth. Add the maple syrup and 2 tablespoons milk and beat on high until smooth. Add the powdered sugar and beat on medium speed until creamy. Drizzle over warm cinnamon rolls. Rolls taste best served on the same day, though they remain fresh for one day covered tightly at room temperature.",

Dice one stick of butter into 1/2-inch pieces and place into the freezer.\nIn a food processor add flour, sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Pulse four times to mix. Sprinkle the butter cubes over the flour and pulse 12 times until butter pieces are the size of tiny peas. Turn on food processor and add 1/4 cup of ice water through the feeding tube.\nOnce water has been incorporated, dump mixture into a large bowl and form a disk. Place disk on a large piece of plastic wrap. Let the dough chill in the fridge for at least two hours or overnight before rolling it out.\nSprinkle surface with flour, remove dough from wrapping and place disk in center; dust top with flour. Roll dough in all directions, until it is 13 inches in diameter and just under 1/8-inch thick.\nPlace dough on pie pan measuring 9-inches across, with excess dough draped over pan lip. With one hand, pick up edges of dough; use index finger of other hand to press dough around pan bottom. Use your fingertips to press dough against pan walls. Trim dough overhanging the pan to an even 1/2-inch all around.\nTuck overhanging dough back under itself so folded edge is flush with edge of pan lip. Press double layer of dough with your fingers to seal, then bend up at a 90-degree angle and flute by pressing thumb and index finger about 1/2-inch apart against outside edge of dough, then using index finger of other hand to poke a dent through the space. Repeat procedure all the way around.\nRefrigerate crust for 20 minutes to firm crust. Using a fork prick dough all along the sides and the bottom. Flatten a 12-inch square of aluminum foil inside crust, pressing it flush against corners, sides, and over rim. Add pie weights on top of the foil. Chill shell for at least 30 minutes (preferably an hour or more), to allow dough to relax.\nAdjust an oven rack to lowest position, and heat oven to 400 degrees. Bake 15 minutes. Remove foil and beans then bake shell for 8 to 10 minutes longer, or until interior just begins to color.\nFor filling, process pumpkin, brown sugar, ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a food processor for 1 minute. Transfer pumpkin mixture to a small pot; bring it to a sputtering simmer over medium-high heat. Cook pumpkin, stirring constantly, until thick and shiny, about 5 minutes. Whisk heavy cream and milk into pumpkin and bring to a bare simmer. Process eggs in food processor until whites and yolks are mixed, about 5 seconds. With motor running, slowly pour about half of hot pumpkin mixture through feed tube. Stop machine and scrape in remaining pumpkin. Process 30 seconds longer.\nImmediately pour warm filling into hot pie shell. Decrease temperature to 350 degrees. Bake until filling is puffed, dry-looking, and lightly cracked around edges, and center wiggles like gelatin when pie is gently shaken, about 30 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for at least 1 hour.

            "1": "First prepare marinade by adding orange juice, wine, 5 garlic cloves, thyme, rosemary, pepper, and olive oil in a blender. Blend until ingredients are mixed well.\nPlace lamb and marinade into a plastic bag. Squeeze out as much of the air as possible from the bag and seal. Wrap again with another plastic bag to ensure that the marinating lamb doesn't leak. Marinate for several hours, or overnight, in the refrigerator. Remove the lamb, still in its marinade bag, from the refrigerator at least an hour before putting in the oven to help bring the lamb closer to room temperature before roasting.\nPreheat oven to 425\u00b0F. Arrange two racks in the oven - a middle rack to hold the lamb, and a lower rack to hold a roasting pan with which to catch the drippings. Place the empty roasting pan in the oven while the oven is pre-heating.\nRemove the lamb roast from its marinade bag. Pat dry the marinade off the lamb with paper towels. Generously salt and pepper all sides of the roast. Cut slits in the roast and insert remaining garlic cloves. Arrange fattiest side up, so while the lamb is cooking the fat will melt into the meat. Place directly on middle rack of the oven, with a roasting pan on a separate rack a rung lower, to catch the drippings. Put some water (a cup or so) in the bottom roasting pan.\nRoast at 425\u00b0F for 20 minutes. Then reduce the heat to 300\u00b0F and roast an additional hour (for a 6 pound roast), about 10-12 minutes per pound.\n*Note that the method of cooking directly on the oven rack will mimic a convection oven and the cooking time/oven temp needed will be less than you would need if you cooked the roast on a rack in a roasting pan. If you are cooking the roast in a roasting pan, rack or not, start the roast at 450\u00b0F and then reduce the heat to 325\u00b0F. Also, the shape of the roast will have an impact on the cooking time. Our roast was rather long and thin, so it cooked up fairly quickly. A thicker roast may take longer than expected.\nAt this point start checking the meat thermometer. Note that every time you open the oven door, you'll need 10 minutes or so to bring the oven back up to temperature, thus slowing down the cooking process. So, don't check too often. Remove from the oven anywhere from 130\u00b0F to 135\u00b0F for medium rare. Lamb should never be cooked until well done or it will be too dry. Let stand for 15-20 minutes before carving. Cut away the kitchen string and slice with a sharp carving knife, 1/2 inch thick slices, against the grain of the meat.\nWhile the roast is resting, scrape up the drippings in the roasting pan. Use the drippings to make a gravy, or use just the drippings themselves to serve with the lamb.",

Gently, drop in the cubes of paneer and gently toss, taking care not to break the cubes. Let the cubes marinate while you get the rest of your ingredients together and prepped.\nThaw the spinach in the microwave, 5 minutes on high, then puree in a food processor or blender until smooth.\nPlace a large nonstick skillet over medium heat, and add the paneer as the pan warms. In a couple of minutes give the pan a toss; each piece of paneer should be browned on one side. Fry another minute or so, and then remove the paneer from the pan onto a plate.\nAdd the remaining 1 1/2 tablespoons oil to the pan. Add the onions, ginger, garlic and chile. Saute the mixture until it's evenly toffee-coloured, which should take about 15 minutes. Don't skip this step - this is the foundation of the dish! If you feel like the mixture is drying out and burning, add a couple of tablespoons of water.\nAdd the garam masala, coriander and cumin. If you haven't already, sprinkle a little water to keep the spices from burning.

Remove the giblets, and thoroughly rinse the chicken inside and out.\nGrab a stock pot. It will ideally be a tall, narrow pot that will just fit the chicken, since it should be totally submerged in the cooking liquid. Put it over medium low heat, and add the oil and ginger.\nLet the ginger caramelize for about 30 seconds. Then add the scallions and cook another 30 seconds. Add the star anise and rice wine, and bring to a simmer to let the alcohol cook off. Add the soy sauce, dark soy sauce, sugar, salt, and water. Bring to a simmer again and cook on low heat for another 20 minutes.\nIncrease the heat to bring the liquid to a slow boil (i.e. a little stronger than a simmer, but not a rolling boil). Use a large roasting fork inserted into the chicken cavity to lower the chicken slowly into the pot breast side up. Make sure any air pockets in the cavity fill up completely with liquid. The chicken should be entirely submerged at this point.\nOnce the chicken goes in, the cooking liquid will cool down. Let it cook for about 5 minutes at medium high heat. Next, use your large fork to carefully lift the chicken out of the water and empty the liquid inside the cavity, which will be cooler than the liquid surrounding the chicken. Lower the chicken back into the pot, making sure once again that there aren't any air pockets in the cavity. If the chicken is not completely submerged, periodically baste the exposed area with cooking liquid.\nBring the liquid back up to a lazy simmer, which should take about 10 minutes. Keep it at this slow simmer (the liquid will be about 210 degrees F) for 25 minutes. Turn off the heat, cover the pot, and let the chicken sit in the pot for another 15 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a cutting board. If you like, you can use a meat thermometer in the thickest part of the thigh to confirm it's reached 165 degrees F.\n8.Use the sauce from the pot to occasionally baste the chicken and keep the skin moist as it cools.

Let cool completely. Can be kept in fridge for up to 3 days, if baked in advance.\nTo make the cake. Heat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray the bottom and sides of an 8- to 9-inch square pan with nonstick spray.\nPeel cooled sweet potatoes and run flesh through a potato ricer, or mash until very smooth. (Do not blend in a blender or food processor.) Measure 1 1/2 packed cups (about 12 to 13 ounces) from sweet potato mash; you may have a little extra.\nWhisk 2 cups flour, 1 3/4 teaspoon baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon baking soda, 1/2 teaspoon salt and spices together in a medium bowl. In a large bowl, beat 1/2 cup butter and 1 cup brown sugar together with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, about 2 to 3 minutes. Add 1 teaspoon vanilla and 2 eggs, and beat until just combined. Mix in sweet potato puree, then stir in dry ingredients just until they disappear.\nSpread batter in prepared pan, and bake cake until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 35 to 40 minutes. Let cake rest in pan for 5 minutes on a cooling rack, then invert onto cooling rack, and let cool completely. You can speed this up, in the fridge.\nTo make the frosting. Place 3 egg whites, 3/4 cup sugar, a pinch of salt and 1/4 teaspoon cream of tartar in a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of gently simmering water. Whisk mixture for 3 minutes, until whites are warmed and sugar granules feels mostly dissolved. Remove bowl from top of saucepan, then, with an electric mixer, beat egg white mixture on high speed until stiff, glossy peaks form, about 4 to 7 minutes longer. Add 1/2 teaspoon vanilla and mix until combined.\nTo frost and decorate. If you\u2019d like to make huge, marshmallow-like dollops, spread a bit of frosting thinly over cooled sweet potato cake. Then, using a very large round piping tip or the corner snipped off a freezer bag, pipe large dollops of frosting all over thin frosting layer. If you\u2019d like to skip the dollops, you can just spread the frosting, thick and swirly, all over. Using a kitchen torch, lightly brown the dollops so that they look like toasted marshmallows.\nServe at room temperature cut into squares. Cake keeps at room temperature for two days; any longer, keep it in the fridge.",

Immediately pour the caramel into a 8-inch mold and quickly swirl it around to cover the bottom and a little up the sides. You have to be quick because the caramel hardens once it starts to cool down. The caramel should have cooled down before you pour the egg mixture in it, place in the roasting pan and set aside.\nPreheat oven to 325 degrees F, bring a kettle of water to a boil for the water bath. Blend the whole milk, condensed milk, vanilla, and eggs in a blender until completely mixed. Pour the flan mixture through a metal strainer right into the caramelized mold.\nPlace the mold into a large cake pan or roasting pan. Pour enough hot water into the pan to come halfway up the sides of the mold. Carefully transfer to the middle oven rack. Bake for 30 to 45 minutes. Test the flan to see if it\u2019s done by inserting a knife near the center. If the flan is still soft, let it cook longer until a knife inserted again comes out clean.\nRemove from the oven carefully and let it cool on the counter to room temperature. Then cover with foil and refrigerate for at least 6 hours, preferably overnight. To serve run a knife around the inside of the mold to loosen the flan and lay a plate on top of the mold then carefully flip it over and slide the mold off.",
